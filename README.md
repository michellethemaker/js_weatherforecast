# js_weatherforecast
uses temperature forecast from data.gov's API

Picking up javascript, as such I made a little weather forecast application. 
Modified version, using temperature forecasts instead of weather forecast.
Fetches API data every 10 seconds or so.
Prints out temperature stations with data.

Useful lesson in automation, & fetching data of different formats.
