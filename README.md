# js_weatherforecast
uses temperature forecast from data.gov's API

Picking up javascript, as such I made a little weather forecast application. 
Modified from automated branch. This branch is for learning Node JS.
Added local server, after activating server, application is identical to that of the automated branch.

Useful lesson in the basics of Node JS.
